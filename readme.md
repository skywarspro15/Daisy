# **Daisy**
An intelligent Discord bot, inspired by a character from YouTube creator [Ethobot](https://www.youtube.com/@ethobot).

### **What can Daisy do?**

  - Daisy can moderate your servers.
    <br/> 
    <br/>
     Unlike regular moderation systems where it finds a certain word, or phrase to filter, Daisy uses machine learning algorithms to check whether content being sent is toxic or not. It can also read text from images, and filter content from there as well.
    <br/> 
    <br/>
     What does this mean? This means that people's ways of bypassing existing moderation systems (such as modifying a bit of that word or phrase) would not work on Daisy's moderation system.

  - Daisy can talk, and converse through chat, or even voice.
    <br />
    <br />
    With speech recognition, text to speech, and natural language technologies, Daisy can engage in conversations in voice channels, or you can chat with her by mentioning her name. 

### **Daisy's limitations**

- You shouldn't use Daisy for full-on automated moderation. 
  <br />
  <br />
  Daisy won't filter all bad comments, and it might not read images properly and mindlessly filter them sometimes. Daisy is still in beta and shouldn't be relied on. 

- Daisy can talk and engage in conversations, but is not perfect. 
  <br />
  <br />
  Yes, it can engage in conversations. But, it's far from perfect. When testing out Daisy's capabilities to talk and chat, she'd often call people the wrong names, or she'd often repeat herself until you rephrase what you meant. 
  <br />
  <br />
  Daisy's speech recognition capabilities aren't perfect, and you might have to say what you're trying to say for her to get it. 
  <br />
  <br />
  Daisy might occasionally ghost you and wouldn't respond to some of your queries. In this case, you may rephrase what you said or say it again. 

<br />
Of course, Daisy's still new. <strong>She isn't perfect and she might make mistakes a human won't make.</strong> You should use her as a tool or for entertainment, and not for complete automation.
